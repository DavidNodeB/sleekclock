# # Sleek Clock

sleek clock is a very basic vanilla js webpage.

# Why did you make sleek clock ?

1. I used to do web development off and on in my free time and this is my introduction back. 
2. Get some fundamentals down. 
3. I will be doing more difficult problems in the future I just wanted to prove to myself that I know how to do basic vanilla js and css.
